SQL Playlist (unsupported)
====

This version of the SQLPlayList plugin is a **one-time only** fix that updates its internal references to the *Dynamic Playlists 3* and *Custom Skip 3* plugins. **No guarantees that it will work or continue to do so**. Otherwise the same as v.2.6.272.<br>
It does not and won't support any of the *new* features or playlist parameters of Dynamic Playlists **3**.
